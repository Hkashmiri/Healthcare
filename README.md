# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
]Of course! Here's a clean and professional **README.md** you can use for your healthcare education portal:

# Smart Healthcare Education Portal

Welcome to the **Smart Healthcare Portal**!  
This project provides a platform where patients, clinicians, and researchers can access educational resources, contribute research papers, and manage clinical assessments.

## Features

- **Educational Hub:**  
  Learn about various healthcare topics in an organized, accessible format.

- **Clinical Portal:**  
  Verified clinicians can view patient assessments, provide feedback, and run deeper analytical evaluations.

- **Research Center:**  
  Users can upload their own research papers and browse research shared by others.

- **Home Remedy Section:**  
  Find safe and easy home remedies for common health issues.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**  
  React.js (with React Router for page navigation)

- **Backend:**  
  Firebase Firestore (database for research paper uploads)

- **Styling:**  
  Basic inline styles (future plans: Tailwind CSS or Material-UI)

## ⚙Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-education-portal.git
cd healthcare-education-portal
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up Firebase**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project
   - Enable **Firestore Database**
   - Copy your project's Firebase config
   - Create a `firebase.js` file inside `/src` and paste your config:

```javascript
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const db = getFirestore(app);

export { db };
```

4. **Run the app**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

## Future Improvements

- Add authentication (patient and clinician login)
- Role-based access for clinicians
- Real-time research updates using Firestore `onSnapshot`
- Admin dashboard
- Improved UI/UX (Tailwind CSS)
